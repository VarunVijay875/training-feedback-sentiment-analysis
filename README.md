## Training Feedback Sentiment Analysis

A Natural Language Processing (NLP) project to analyze and summarize open-ended feedback from participants of **Nest Digital Academy** training programs. This project uses sentiment analysis, text preprocessing, machine learning, and data visualization to uncover insights and highlight areas of improvement.

---

## Objective

The goal of this project is to automatically analyze qualitative feedback from course participants to:
- Identify the sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) behind each response
- Summarize frequently mentioned themes using word clouds
- Train a machine learning model to classify feedback based on sentiment
- Help Nest Digital Academy enhance the quality of its training programs

---

## Methodology

ðŸ”¹ Data Collection
- Source: Excel file with multiple sheets
- Target columns:
  - *What do you like most about the training?*
  - *Any suggestions for the training?*

ðŸ”¹ Preprocessing
- Lowercasing, punctuation and stopword removal
- Tokenization and cleaning of text responses
- Labeling empty responses as `"nil"`

ðŸ”¹ Sentiment Analysis
- Tool: **VADER** from NLTK
- Compound sentiment score determines:
  - Positive (â‰¥ 0.05)
  - Neutral (between -0.05 and 0.05)
  - Negative (â‰¤ -0.05)

ðŸ”¹ Machine Learning
- TF-IDF vectorization of cleaned text
- Logistic Regression classifier for sentiment prediction
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

ðŸ”¹ Visualizations
- Word clouds for both feedback questions
- Sentiment distribution summary
- Exported CSV with sentiment labels and scores

---

## Results

- Sentiment classification performed well on responses with diverse sentiment
- Word clouds clearly highlighted key terms and concerns
- Overall sentiment scores were calculated for each question

## Requirements

Make sure to install the required Python packages:

pip install pandas nltk scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn wordcloud

Also, download required NLTK resources:

import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')

---

## How to Run

python sentiment_analysis.py

Make sure the `Test Sheet.xlsx` file is in the same directory.

---

## Future Improvements

- Add support for multilingual feedback
- Integrate deep learning models (e.g., BERT) for richer analysis
- Build a simple dashboard to visualize live feedback summaries
